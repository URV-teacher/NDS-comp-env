# NDS-comp-env
Compile NDS projects in Linux environments using Docker.

[I used Dockurr/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows) to build a VM to compile the software, but it was not what I was looking for. 

I ended up building a Docker image with capabilities to compile the software successfully. You can find it [here](https://github.com/URV-teacher/bmde-linux)

I will leave this repo archived as it does not work.
